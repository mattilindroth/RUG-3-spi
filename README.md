# RUG-3-spi
Making arduino to get sensor data from Inertial sense RUG-3 using SPI

## PINS
To set up the hardware I have set the following pins:
* 1 to GND
* 2 to GND
* 3 to Arduino 5V power out
* 7 to Arduino SCK
* 8 to Arduino MISO
* 9 to Arduino PIN 7 (Chip select)
* 10 to Arduino MOSI
 
As suggested here : https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/hardware/rugged3/

Pins 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12 are left floating (not connected)
